## About
I am a final year PhD student at the Alan Turing Institute, affiliated with the University of Edinburgh. I am supervised by [David Aspinall](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/da/) and [Adria Gascon](https://www.lsi.upc.edu/~agascon/). My research lies at the intersection of cryptography and formal methonds. In particular I am interested in computer aided security proofs. I work on providing machine checked proofs for proofs of security of low level primitves and Multi Party Computation (MPC) protocols.

Before the Alan Turing Institute I completed my masters (First Class Honours, MMath) at Durham University. 

For more details on my research, see my [publications](https://davetbutler.github.io/publications/) page or my [google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=b-9lOqgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra), or feel free to contact me directly.

In 2028 I spent time working at the NASA Ames Research Center in California. You can read about what I got up to [here](https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/turing-phd-student-david-butler-interns-nasa-analysing-safety-unmanned-aircraft).

## News

* We had our [paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1449.pdf) accepted at CPP 2020. In this work we extend our formalisation of MPC to the malicious setting.

* We have a new [paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1185.pdf) out, extending our work from POST 2019 on sigma protocols and commitment schemes.
